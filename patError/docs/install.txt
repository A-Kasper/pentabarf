patError Installation
=====================
This is a very short document, that tries to help you setting up patError for basic
usage. Please read the readme.txt for further information.

INSTALLATION:
=============
patError is a very small package that basically consits of two classes seperated in two
files in the include-directory:

	patError.php
	patErrorManager.php

Just copy these files to your include-directory. 

TESTING:
========
For testing patError, include "patErrorManager.php" and call the static methods:
Example:
<?PHP
	include_once 'include/patErrorManager.php';
	patErrorManager::raiseError( 111, 'Test', 'Testing patErrorManager' );
?>

Notice, that patError.php will be included automatically!
